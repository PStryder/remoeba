# Open questions and known failure modes

Nothing here is rhetorical. Each item is either unresolved or a real way this
system can fail.

## Unresolved design questions

**Does board-mediated collaboration make the swarm better or just louder?**
The machinery to answer this now exists — `board_access="none"` produces
naive neuocytes, and `board_corroboration` separates replication from echo — but
the experiment has not been run. It is entirely possible that shared context
spreads Ego's mistakes faster than it spreads its insight.

**Does a specialised neuocyte profile actually produce better work?** The
Prompt Library makes `ego.neuocyte.research` expressible, governed and
attributable, and every incarnation records exactly which lineage it was born
with — so the experiment is now *answerable*. It has not been run. Nothing in
the system measures whether a profile performs better than its parent:
`experimental_approved` exists and is honoured, but selecting an experimental
lineage and comparing outcomes is manual. Id records verdicts, and a verdict is
a judgement, not a measurement.

**How much should a parent be allowed to say?** Composition accumulates down
the whole lineage, so a three-level profile carries its root's full text plus
every descendant's addition. That is what makes provenance honest, and it also
means a deep tree spends context on inherited instruction before the task is
stated. Whether `replace` should be more common than `append` below the first
level is an open question about prompt economics, not about the mechanism.

**What should a trimmed context keep?** `trim` keeps a verbatim head and tail
because those are defensible without a model in the loop. Whether the middle is
the least valuable part of a cognitive context is an assumption, not a finding.

**Is a 4B model good enough for both roles?**
Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 follows the structured formats Ego, Id and neuocytes need,
and produces coherent short answers. Whether it can do *genuine* synthesis or a
*genuine* audit was not evaluated. No quality benchmark was run. The honest
position is that the plumbing is proven and the cognition is not.

**How independent is Id's judgement?**
Id has a separate process, a separate private context and no access to Ego's
snapshot, and it audits the record rather than asking Ego to defend itself.
But it shares the same weights and often the same selected memories. Separate
context is not independent judgement. Two genuinely independent judgements
would need different models — which conflicts with the one-resident-weight-set
policy. This is unresolved.

**What authority lets Id revise a belief?**
Today: none directly. Id can record an audit, open a disagreement and propose
maintenance. It cannot supersede an Ego belief on its own. That is deliberate
but it also means contradictions can accumulate unresolved, and there is no
policy yet for who breaks a tie between a user goal and a maintenance goal.

**Does an Ego-derived shared projection actually help?**
Not measured. Forking is cheap and correct, but whether a neuocyte inheriting
Ego's context produces better findings than a neuocyte given a narrow brief is an
open empirical question — and a shared prefix spreads Ego's mistakes as
efficiently as its context.

## Runtime failure modes

**Greedy decoding is not reproducible.** Identical tokens in different cache
positions give slightly different logits (see RUNTIME.md §3). This affects
forks and recomputations equally. Do not build anything on bit-exact replay.

**Thread safety.** llama.cpp contexts are not thread safe; one lock serialises
every call. A long generation therefore blocks every other session, including
Id's health introspection path that needs inference. Health itself stays
answerable because it does not require inference.

**Unified KV taxes decode in proportion to occupancy.** Measured 1.94x
slowdown with 63 idle sessions resident, fully reversible on retirement. This
is the price of the shared pool that makes prefix sharing possible. There is no
mitigation in place beyond retiring promptly; a future option would be to trim
or evict idle sessions on a timer, which is not implemented.

**Context overflow.** `n_ctx` is a shared pool. A long Ego context plus several
forked neuocytes can exhaust it; `llama_decode` returns 1 and the engine raises
`resource_exhausted`. There is now a homeostasis path that trims and reborns a
role context at critical pressure
([HOMEOSTASIS](HOMEOSTASIS.md)), which buys headroom but does not remove the
ceiling: trimming drops a span of live context, and a mind whose *useful*
working set genuinely exceeds the pool will still hit the wall. Compaction is
not implemented.

**Snapshot growth.** Ego's context grows monotonically within a run until
rejuvenation trims it. Summarisation is still refused, deliberately: it is a
different behaviour from reconstitution, not a better version of it. The
open question is whether verbatim head+tail is the right thing to keep, which
is an empirical question nobody has answered here.

**Positional consistency.** A fork copies positions `[0, prefix_len)` and the
neuocyte continues from `prefix_len`. Nothing currently shifts positions, so
`llama_memory_seq_add` / `seq_div` are unused and untested here. Any future
context trimming would have to deal with RoPE position shifts, and
`llama_memory_can_shift` would need checking first.

**Model change mid-flight.** A rolling upgrade would briefly need two weight
sets. Under the one-resident-set policy the old generation must be drained —
including Ego and Id sessions — before the next model loads. The refusal path
(`capability_unsupported` on a cross-generation snapshot) is implemented and
tested; the *drain* sequence is not.

**Disk full / invalid checkpoint / tokenizer mismatch.** Blob writes are
fsynced before commit, so a full disk fails the mutation cleanly rather than
committing a dangling reference. An invalid GGUF fails at load with
`backend_unavailable`. A tokenizer change alters `model_generation`, which
invalidates snapshot reuse. None of these three paths has a dedicated test.

**Hash chaining is not administrator-proof.** Anyone with write access to the
SQLite file can rewrite rows and recompute every hash. Real immutability would
need checkpoints exported to independent append-only storage. Every integrity
report states this.

**Cancellation granularity.** A generation stops between tokens (~6 ms), which
is fine. A long *prefill* is not interruptible: that would need llama.cpp's
`abort_callback` on the compute path, and putting a Python callback there
risks GIL and deadlock problems that were not worth taking on for the benefit.
A cancel issued during a 6000-token prefill waits for it to finish.

**Windows process identity.** The venv `python.exe` is a trampoline, so
`Popen.pid` is not the pid of the interpreter serving RPC. Supervision uses
reachability with a grace period rather than trusting `poll()`. A child that is
alive but wedged for longer than the grace period will be killed and restarted.

**Loopback security.** The control plane is loopback TCP with a shared token in
the state directory. That stops another local process without filesystem access
to the token; it is not a security boundary against a user who can read the
state directory. There is no TLS and no remote transport.

## Built but not connected

Nothing currently sits in this category. The tool execution loop, which was
here, is wired: a neuocyte's request is parsed, validated, executed by the
Harness through `tool_invoke`, and the result appended to its context for the
next turn, bounded by turns, token budget and deadline, every call receipted.
See `TOOL_LOOP.md` and `tests/test_tool_loop.py`.

## Not implemented

- Remote MCP transport (a separate, separately secured concern).
- Independent overlapping GPU execution. Not attempted: llama.cpp contexts are
  not thread safe, so the engine serialises every call. Nsight Systems, the one
  tool that could verify overlap if it were implemented, is not installed;
  Nsight Compute is installed but serialises kernels by design.
- Duplicated-weights multi-process comparison (condition C in the brief's
  concurrency matrix): not run, because the design commits to one GPU owner and
  the measurement would not change that decision.
- Streaming token output over MCP.
- Automatic context trimming, eviction or compaction.
- Automatic A/B measurement of prompt profiles. `experimental_approved`
  and the experimental selection purpose are honoured, but nothing
  compares outcomes between lineages.
