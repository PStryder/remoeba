# Host files

Amoeba can produce files you actually use, and can be handed files to work on.
Both go through the Harness, and both are bounded by an allowlist.

## Configuration

No roots are configured by default, and with none configured Amoeba has no host
filesystem access at all. Roots are added explicitly:

```toml
[[filespace.roots]]
name = "out"
path = "C:/Users/YOUR_NAME/Amoeba/output"
mode = "read_write"
description = "where Amoeba puts things it produces"

[[filespace.roots]]
name = "project"
path = "C:/Users/YOUR_NAME/projects/example"
mode = "read_only"
```

A path that does not resolve inside one of these is **refused** — not
sanitised, not clamped into the nearest root. There is no default destination,
so a bug that loses the root name produces an error rather than a write
somewhere arbitrary.

## Verbs

| Verb | Who | What |
|---|---|---|
| `file_roots` | anyone | what Amoeba may touch, and how |
| `file_list` / `file_read` | Harness | read inside a root |
| `file_write` / `file_delete` | Harness | write inside a read-write root |
| `file_versions` / `file_restore` | Harness | list and recover earlier versions |
| `file_attach` | you | hand a named file to a work item |
| `artifact_promote(root=, path=)` | Harness | turn a proposal into a real file |

All are exposed over MCP as `mind_file_*` and `mind_artifact_promote`.

## No write destroys

Before any overwrite, delete, or promotion-over, the existing bytes are
content-addressed into the blob store and the digest goes into the event log as
`file.superseded`. Every version stays recoverable:

```
mind_file_versions(root="out", path="report.md")
  → [{sha256: "a1b2…", kind: "file.written",    restorable: true},
     {sha256: "9f0e…", kind: "file.superseded", restorable: true}]

mind_file_restore(root="out", path="report.md", sha256="9f0e…")
```

Restoring is itself a write, so whatever it replaces is snapshotted too — undo
is not a way to lose the current version.

This is what makes it safe to let a mind write to disk: a neuocyte's work can
be wrong, and being wrong supersedes rather than destroys.

## What a neuocyte can and cannot do

A neuocyte has **no verb that reaches the host filesystem**. Its tools address
its own sandbox, and nothing in its vocabulary names a filespace root. Files
leave a sandbox one way:

```
neuocyte: propose_artifact(path="work/checker.py", rationale="…")
          ↓ (a proposal; nothing is copied)
you:      mind_artifact_promote(artifact_id=…, root="out", path="checker.py")
```

The promoter names the destination. The neuocyte that produced the bytes never
sees it, and the content is re-hashed at the moment of copying — if it changed
since it was proposed, the promotion is refused outright.

Input is symmetric: nothing is read that was not named. `file_attach` takes an
explicit path, requires it to be inside a root, content-addresses it on the way
in, and copies it into that work item's sandbox. Because the bytes are stored
by digest, a finding about a file can later be checked against exactly the
content that produced it.

## Path resolution

The caller is ultimately a language model, and Windows has more ways to name a
path than POSIX. Each of these is refused explicitly:

| Trap | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| `..` traversal | the obvious one |
| absolute paths, drive letters, `\\server\share` | ignore the root entirely |
| `\\?\` long-path prefix | bypasses normalisation Win32 would otherwise do |
| alternate data streams (`notes.txt:hidden`) | writes content no listing shows |
| device names (`CON`, `NUL`, `COM1`) | open a device, not a file |
| trailing dots and spaces | Windows strips them, so `x.txt.` and `x.txt` are one file that compares as two names |
| symlinks and junctions | a link inside the root can point anywhere |
| **hard links** | a second name for the same file record; nothing about the path is unusual, so only the link count reveals it |

Whitespace is deliberately *not* stripped from a path. Stripping would turn
`notes.txt ` into `notes.txt` silently — resolving the ambiguity instead of
refusing it, which is the opposite of the job.

Symlinks and junctions are the first interesting case, because the string
looks fine: a junction inside a root is an ordinary-looking name that resolves
elsewhere. Paths are resolved fully and re-checked for containment, listings
skip them rather than walking through, and writes refuse to go through one.

**Hard links are the harder case**, and the first implementation was wrong
about them. A hard link is not a pointer to a file — it *is* the file, a second
directory entry for the same record. There is nothing to resolve,
`is_symlink()` is false, and containment says "inside the root" and is telling
the truth about the path while being wrong about the file.

Measured, not reasoned about:

```
mklink /H out\innocent.txt private\secret.txt
  same volume serial + file index, st_nlink = 2, is_symlink() = False
  containment: INSIDE
  READ   -> returned "ORIGINAL SECRET"   ← leak
  WRITE  -> outside file unchanged
  DELETE -> outside name survived
```

So the read was a genuine leak: the allowlist was a claim about paths, not
about files. Files with more than one name are now refused at resolution, and
listings show them flagged `multiply_linked` / `accessible: false` rather than
hiding them.

The write result deserves explaining rather than celebrating. `write_bytes`
writes a temp file and renames it over the target, which replaces the
*directory entry* — so a write never modifies an existing file record in place
and cannot reach a file's other names. That is real, but it was accidental, and
rewriting it as `path.write_bytes(data)` would silently make write-through
live. It is pinned by a test. Its flip side: writing to a legitimately
hard-linked file silently breaks the link, leaving the other name with the old
content.

Delete is safe by NTFS semantics — the record survives until its last name is
removed.

`allow_multiply_linked = true` turns the refusal off. It is off by default, and
turning it on really does open the door; there is a test that pins that too, so
the flag cannot quietly stop meaning anything.

### Other reparse types

Probed rather than assumed. File symlinks (tag `0xa000000c`) and directory
symlinks carry a different tag from junctions (`0xa0000003`), and unlike
junctions they *do* report `is_symlink() == True` — but all three are caught
the same way, by resolving fully and re-checking containment. No reparse type
tested resolved *inside* the root while the OS opened something outside, which
is the combination that would be a real breach.

## One file, one identity

Separate from containment, and it took its own experiment to find.

NTFS is case-insensitive and keeps 8.3 aliases, so these are all one file:

```
report.md   REPORT.MD   Report.Md   REPORT~1.MD
```

Nothing escapes — each lands on exactly the right file. The bug was that the
identity key came from *how the caller spelled it*, so each spelling kept its
own version history:

```
file_write(path="report.md",  content="v1")
file_write(path="REPORT.MD",  content="v2")   ← supersedes v1 on disk
file_versions(path="report.md")               ← did NOT list the v1 snapshot
```

The v1 bytes were still in the blob store. They just were not *findable* from
the name anyone would actually use — and "recoverable" and "discoverable" are
not the same guarantee. The second is the one that matters when someone is
trying to undo something.

The key is now taken from the resolved on-disk path: `resolve()` returns the
true spelling for a file that exists and leaves a new path as given, which is
what both cases want. A new file keeps the spelling it was created with; an
existing one is always reported under the name it actually has.

## The input circuit

```
you:      mind_file_attach(path="C:/Users/YOUR_NAME/projects/example/module.py", work_id=…)
             │
Harness:     ├─ resolve inside an allowlisted root      (refuse otherwise)
             ├─ read the bytes
             ├─ content-address into the blob store     (durable, by digest)
             ├─ copy the exact bytes into that work item's sandbox scratch
             ├─ re-hash what landed and refuse a mismatch
             └─ emit file.attached + receipt, carrying both digests
neuocyte:  reads work/steering.py inside its container
```

Two things this is *not*:

* It does not write into a filespace root. The roots are where your files
  already live; the copies go into the blob store and into one sandbox.
* It is not shared with "the neuocytes". It lands in **one work item's**
  sandbox, reachable only by the neuocyte holding that work item. Another work
  item's neuocyte cannot see it, and there is no argument in which to name
  someone else's sandbox.

The durable copy is the point of the blob store: a finding about a file can be
checked later against the exact bytes that produced it, even after the source
has changed on disk.

## A digest is ground truth

If a receipt says a neuocyte received bytes with digest D, then hashing the
bytes actually available to that neuocyte produces D. The environment has to be
trustworthy enough to reason from; "this is what you were given" cannot be
approximate.

This is tested by hashing **from inside the container**, not from the test
process, because a check the Harness runs on itself proves only that the
Harness is self-consistent. The first version of `file_attach` passed every
Harness-side check while handing the sandbox different bytes: it routed content
through `str`, which replaces each non-UTF-8 byte with U+FFFD. 18 bytes in, 40
bytes out — and the receipt still recorded the source digest, so it claimed the
neuocyte had seen content it never saw. That is the failure that matters:
corruption is a bug, but a receipt that misdescribes it is a lie the whole
provenance chain rests on.

There is no lossy surface. `read_file` returns text, so it returns **exact
text or nothing**: if the bytes are not UTF-8 there is no correct string to
hand back, and a flagged rendering is still something a model will reason about
as though it were the file.

```
file_read(root="out", path="blob.bin")
  → refused: "this file is not UTF-8 text, so it cannot be returned as text;
              use the run_code tool to read the bytes"
              path, bytes, sha256, invalid_at
```

The refusal carries everything except the bytes, so a caller learns the size
and digest and is told the verb that does work. Arbitrary bytes are read
through `run_code`, which sees them exactly — that is how a neuocyte inspects
a PNG, a pickle or a `.gguf`.

A truncated read is trimmed back to a character boundary before decoding, so a
cap landing mid-character costs at most one character rather than making an
ordinary text file look like binary.

An explicitly lossy preview verb may be added later if it proves useful. It
would be a separate verb with a name that says what it is, not a quiet mode of
this one.

## Residual risk, stated plainly

**Resolution and the subsequent open are not atomic.** A link swapped in
between the two would be followed. Closing that properly needs `O_NOFOLLOW`
semantics Windows does not offer through `pathlib`. It requires an attacker
already running as this account and racing a specific operation — and the same
account can rewrite the roots' ACLs anyway (see `SANDBOX.md`), so this is not
the weakest link, but it is a gap rather than a guarantee.

**Configured roots are not hardened.** Unlike Amoeba's own state tree, these
are your directories. Locking down a directory you work in would be a
surprising side effect of pointing Amoeba at it, so `harden_state_tree` leaves
them alone.

**A read-write root is genuinely writable.** Amoeba can create, overwrite and
delete files there. The protection is that every version is recoverable, not
that changes are prevented. Point a read-write root at a directory you are
willing to see change; use `read_only` for anything you are not.
