"""What may be forgotten, and what may never be.

Remoeba's premise is a durable, hash-chained record. That makes retention a
narrower question than it usually is: most of this database is evidence, and
evidence is not a cache. The policy is therefore written as two explicit
lists -- what is never pruned, and what is -- rather than as a rule with
exceptions, because a rule invites the next person to reason their way to an
exception.

**Never pruned.** `events` and `receipts` are the chain; deleting a link does
not free space so much as destroy the ability to verify the rest. Conclusions,
audits and disagreements are what the organism decided and what it disputed.
Memory is what it believes. The prompt library is what it was told to be, and
a turn recorded against a profile version whose row was deleted is a turn
nobody can reconstruct.

**Pruned.** Consumed and expired triggers, and the closed turns that consumed
them. These are an operational index: which cognitive inputs are outstanding,
which turn is open, what the last few turns did. The events remain, and they
carry the bundle digests, so a pruned turn is still reconstructable from the
record -- it simply stops appearing in the working views.

**Not collected.** Blob bytes. Roughly twenty columns reference a digest and
event payloads embed more inside JSON, so a reference scan that missed one
source would delete content a hash-chained event points at, and the damage
would be silent until somebody tried to resolve provenance. `footprint`
measures what such a collector would be reasoning about; building one on
measurements is a better bet than building one on confidence.
