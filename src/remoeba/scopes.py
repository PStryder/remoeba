"""Who may call what, declared in one place.

The capability boundary between Id and a neuocyte is **architectural absence**,
not a permission check. A verb outside a caller's table does not exist for that
caller: the dispatcher never finds it, the error does not name it, and there is
no shared implementation carrying an ``if caller != id`` that could be reasoned
around or refactored away.

The scope a connection gets is decided by the secret it presents, so there is
no role, caller, actor or work-class field anywhere in the handshake for a
caller to forge. Presenting the neuocyte secret *is* being a neuocyte.

Three rules this file is built on:

1. **Derived from call sites.** Each scope lists what that caller actually
   calls, traced from its source. A verb nobody calls is capability nobody
   asked for, and it is the ones nobody noticed granting that matter.
2. **Neuocyte is the narrowest.** It holds exactly the lifecycle, snapshot,
   board and tool verbs the neuocyte process uses -- and nothing that reads or
   changes the mind's own state.
3. **Id-only is genuinely id-only.** Id's effectors appear in no other table,
   including Ego's. Ego and Id share a base because they are both long-lived
   role processes, not because they should share authority.

Residual limit, stated rather than implied: these are files in the state
directory, so a process already running as the Remoeba account can read any of
them. This is the same boundary documented in ``security.py`` -- it removes
accidental and model-driven capability, not a determined same-account process.
The genuinely untrusted execution environment is the compute sandbox, and that
provably cannot reach the state directory or the network at all.
