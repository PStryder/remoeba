"""Host files: an allowlist, and nothing outside it.

Remoeba can produce files you actually use, and can be handed files to work on.
Both go through here, and here is the only place that turns a caller-supplied
string into a host path.

**The allowlist is the boundary.** Configured roots name specific directories
and whether each is writable. A path that does not resolve inside one of them
is refused -- not sanitised, not clamped, refused. There is no fallback root
and no "default" location, so a bug that loses the root name produces an error
rather than a write somewhere arbitrary.

**Every destructive act is reversible.** Before an overwrite or a delete the
existing bytes are content-addressed into the blob store and the digest is put
in the event log, so any prior version can be restored by digest. That is the
answer to a neuocyte writing something wrong: it cannot destroy, only
supersede.

## Why the resolution is fussy

The caller is ultimately a language model, and Windows has more ways to name a
path than POSIX does. Each of these is refused explicitly rather than left to
whatever ``Path`` happens to do:

| Trap | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| ``..`` traversal | the obvious one |
| absolute paths, drive letters, ``\\\\server\\share`` | ignore the root entirely |
| ``\\\\?\\`` long-path prefix | bypasses normalisation Win32 would otherwise do |
| alternate data streams (``notes.txt:hidden``) | writes content that does not show up in a listing |
| device names (``CON``, ``NUL``, ``COM1``) | open a device, not a file, wherever they appear |
| trailing dots and spaces | Windows silently strips them, so ``secret.txt.`` and ``secret.txt`` are the same file but compare differently |
| symlinks and junctions | a link inside the root can point anywhere |
| **hard links** | a second name for the same file record; nothing about the path is unusual, so only the link count reveals it |

Symlinks and junctions are handled by resolving fully and re-checking
containment, and writes refuse to go *through* one at all.

Hard links are a different problem and were missed on the first pass. A
hard link does not *point* at a file, it **is** the file: a second
directory entry for the same MFT record. ``resolve()`` has nothing to
resolve, ``is_symlink()`` is False, and containment correctly reports the
path as inside the root while the record is also reachable under a name
outside it. Measured before the fix: a planted hard link read content from
outside the root. The only signal is the file's link count, so a file with
more than one name is refused.

## The honest gap

Resolution and the subsequent open are not atomic. A link swapped in between
the two would be followed -- a TOCTOU race. Closing it properly needs
``O_NOFOLLOW`` semantics Windows does not offer through ``pathlib``, so it is
stated here rather than papered over. It requires an attacker already running
as this account and racing a specific operation; the same account can rewrite
the roots' ACLs anyway (see ``security.py``), so this is not the weakest link.

        again. It is a second line of defence: multiply-linked files are
        refused at resolution.
