"""The Prompt Library: Remoeba's versioned cognitive family tree.

`model` is the vocabulary, `store` the immutable persistence and governance,
`resolver` the inheritance and composition, `bootstrap` the shipped baseline,
and `cascade` the propagation of a parent change. The RPC surface lives one
level up in `prompt_api`, because it belongs to the Harness rather than to the
library.

The `prompts/` directory ships beside this module on purpose: it is the only
origin of a root, and shipping it inside the package means the baseline travels
with the code and is reviewed in the repository rather than typed into a
running system.
