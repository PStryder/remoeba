    folds the predecessor's hash into each event, so the recomputed comparison

    It also means only one of them can be tested. There is no edit the

    mutant targets the recomputed hash -- the one a test can negate -- and the
    ``prev_hash`` check is declared masked in scripts/verify_invariants.py with
