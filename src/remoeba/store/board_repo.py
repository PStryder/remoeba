"""The cognitive blackboard: how neuocytes talk to each other.

**The board is communication, not Mind State.** A post is something a neuocyte
*said*. A memory item is something the organism *believes*. Nothing crosses
that line implicitly: promoting a post into maintained memory is a separate,
receipted act performed by the Harness, and the post keeps its own identity
afterwards.

## Why agreement is graded, and on what

Two neuocytes reaching the same finding is either the most valuable signal the
swarm produces or the least. Counting it wrongly is how a swarm talks itself
into a confident mistake: one observation wearing two coats.

The question used to be *had the second one already read the first?* -- and
whenever it had not, the two were called independent. That is a question about
influence, and it gets the evidence wrong in the one case that matters most. A
neuocyte forked from Ego's context is board-naive by construction: it never
reads a post, because it inherits the observations themselves. It could
restate everything Ego had seen and score independent every time, which is
exactly what happened live on 2026-09-24.

So the question is now *did the second one observe something the first did
not?* Acquisitions are recorded as they happen, against the actor that made
them, and a fork copies the forker's roots to the heir marked `inherited`.
:meth:`independence` counts distinct acquisitions; :meth:`corroboration`
counts only those. Agreeing from shared evidence is still reported, as
`concurring_reasoning`, because two routes to one answer says something about
the reasoning -- it just says nothing further about the evidence (I138).

Influence is still tracked, and still worth knowing. `record_read` is called on
every retrieval, and every post snapshots `informed_by`: the exact set of posts
its author had read *before* it was written. That snapshot is immutable.
`board_naive` is its strongest form -- the author had read nothing at all --
and it means no post influenced this one, not that this one is a second
witness.

                                   observation, and never corroboration.
          socially_informed        it had read the other post first: a named
