"""Filesystem hardening for the Remoeba state tree.

The sandbox's *outward* boundary — what code inside it can reach — is an
AppContainer, and it holds (see ``sandbox.py``). This module is about the
*inward* boundary: what the rest of the machine can do to Remoeba's files.

Those are different problems and the second one was open. A directory created
under a permissive parent inherits that parent's DACL, and the parent this was
first measured under granted ``Everyone:(OI)(CI)(F)`` -- as many a secondary
data drive does. Before this module existed every Remoeba directory was
therefore world-writable, which meant:

* **Injection.** The sandbox runtime is a copied CPython tree. Anyone could
  overwrite a stdlib ``.py`` file or a DLL, and the next neuocyte run would
  execute it *inside* the container, with the container's rights. The
  AppContainer bounds what that code can reach; it does nothing about what code
  gets to run.
* **Exfiltration.** Scratch contents — including anything a neuocyte was asked
  to work on — were readable by any process on the machine.
* **Tampering.** The event log, the content-addressed blobs and the promoted
  artifact store were writable by any process. The hash chain detects that,
  detection after the fact is not the same as prevention.

## What hardening does

Each protected directory gets inheritance removed and an explicit DACL:

| Principal | Gets |
|---|---|
| The account Remoeba runs as | full control (it has to work) |
| ``SYSTEM`` | full control (removing it breaks the OS's own housekeeping) |
| ``Administrators`` | full control (excluding them is theatre; see below) |
| An AppContainer SID | only on its own scratch, or read+execute on the runtime |
| **Everyone / Users / Authenticated Users** | **nothing** |

## What it does not do, stated plainly

**A process running as the same account can undo this.** The Remoeba user owns
these directories, and on Windows an object's owner implicitly holds
``WRITE_DAC``: it can rewrite the ACL and restore its own access. Hardening
therefore stops *other* accounts and stops casual or accidental access from
this one — a backup agent, an indexer, a careless script, another tool. It is
not a boundary against a determined process running as you.

The real fix for that threat is a dedicated low-privilege account for Remoeba,
which is a deployment decision rather than something this code can impose.
``audit_paths`` reports the residual exposure so it stays visible instead of
being assumed away.

Administrators and SYSTEM can take ownership regardless, so listing them is
honesty about who is already trusted, not a grant of new power.
