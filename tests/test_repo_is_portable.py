"""The repository clones and runs somewhere that is not this machine.

Every tracked file used to be free to name one operator's filesystem, and
several did: the package's own default `state_dir`, both config files, two
benchmark scripts, and a sandbox-escape test that opened a database by
absolute path. On any other machine those defaults pointed nowhere -- and
worse, the sandbox test passed, because the file it tried to steal was not
there to refuse.

These are cheap to check and easy to reintroduce, so they are checked.
