"""Host filesystem access: the allowlist is the boundary.

Two claims carry everything else here:

1. **Nothing outside a configured root is reachable.** Not clamped into the
   root, not sanitised -- refused. The caller is ultimately a language model,
   so a path that tries to escape is a signal, not a typo.
2. **No write destroys.** Prior content is content-addressed before any
   overwrite or delete, so every version is recoverable by digest. This is what
   makes it safe to let a mind write to disk at all.

The escape tests below are parametrised over the specific tricks that work on
Windows, not just ``..``. Several of them -- alternate data streams, trailing
dots, reserved device names -- are silent on Windows: the write succeeds and
goes somewhere other than where the string appears to point.
