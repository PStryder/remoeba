"""The inward boundary, asserted at the layer the guarantee lives on.

``sandbox.py`` protects the host from code running inside a container. This
file is about the opposite direction: what the rest of the machine can do to
Remoeba's files. The threat is concrete rather than theoretical -- a writable
sandbox runtime is a code-injection path straight into the container, and a
readable scratch tree is exfiltration of whatever a neuocyte was working on.

Every assertion here reads the DACL **the OS reports**, not the return value of
our own hardening call. A ``HardenResult`` saying ``hardened=True`` is
bookkeeping; ``icacls`` saying ``Everyone`` is absent is the guarantee. The
first test deliberately proves the exposure is real before the rest prove it is
closed, because a suite that only ever sees hardened directories cannot tell
the difference between protection and a no-op.
